## About the project, brief description

The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal changes so that the instruction format remains the same.

This project is a continuation of another project made by me:\
https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-Computer

where I optimized the SAP-1 calculator at the block diagram level.
I obtained four block diagrams:

The final block diagram of the CPU part of the system is:

The final block diagram of the Computer Memory system is:
